Knights Templar
The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Latin: Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici), 
also known as the Order of Solomon's Temple (French: Ordre du Temple or Templiers), the Knights Templar or simply as Templars, 
were a Catholic military order recognised in 1139 by papal bull Omne Datum Optimum of the Holy See. The order was founded in 1119 
and active from about 1129 to 1312.
The order, which was among the wealthiest and most powerful, became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in 
membership and power. They were prominent in Christian finance. Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, 
were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. Non-combatant members of the order managed a large economic 
infrastructure throughout Christendom, developing innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking, and building 
fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land.
The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the order faded. Rumours about the 
Templars' secret initiation ceremony created distrust, and King Philip IV of France – deeply in debt to the order – took advantage 
of the situation to gain control over them. In 1307, he had many of the order's members in France arrested, tortured into giving false 
confessions, and burned at the stake. Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312 under pressure from King Philip.
The abrupt reduction in power of a significant group in European society gave rise to speculation, legend, and legacy through the ages. 
The appropriation of their name by later organizations has kept the name "Templar" alive to the present day, while helping to obscure 
its origin.
